# Frontend Structure (Replaced)

This document has been superseded by:

- `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`

Use the canonical document above for the current frontend architecture, including:

- feature-based screens under `src/features/<feature>/screens`
- data hooks vs workflow hooks
- dependency direction and feature API façade rules
- thin screen responsibilities
- cross-feature orchestration policy

This file is kept temporarily as a compatibility pointer for older links and references.
